
After installing OpenCV 2, SciPy, Numpy and Python 2.7, now you can launch the real-time playing card recognizer by:
python sift-based-recognition-realtime.py

This program is based on computer camera, and it utilizes all the JPG files in the folder to generate SIFT matching models. 
For test cases, only provided JPG cards could be recognized by the realtime camera.
